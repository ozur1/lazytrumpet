      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p id="what">Hello! My name is Ori Zur, and I'm the creator of The Lazy Trumpet. Before we get into all of the details, a little about me.
      I've been a multi-instramentalist for the majority of my life now, but I've always played string or rhythm section instruments (piano, cello, guitar, bass, etc.).
      The closest I've come to playing any woodwind or brass instruments is the melodica. I recently became insterested in learning how to play the trumpet,
      but changed my mind when I realized how much work I would have to put in to learn not only the fingerings, but how to buzz my lips, control my embouchure, and
      learn the many other techniques required to produce a nice-sounding tone. Instead of doing that, I wanted to create an instrument that skips all of those steps,
      and hence The Lazy Trumpet was born!</p>

      <p id="what">Instead of buzzing your lips, all you have to do is blow into the plastic tube in the front. Instead of tightening or loosening embouchure,
      just turn the blue knob on the left. If you want that smooth muted trumpet sound without buying a mute, just move your hand close to the sensor in the back.
      The only part of the controls that actually is the same as a acoustic trumpet is the three "valve" buttons on top, which control the pitches just like they
      do on a normal trumpet.</p>

    <div class="how">
      <h2>How does is work?</h2>
      <p id="how">The Lazy Trumpet is a digital instrument whose sound is controlled by the user's interaction with the sensors on the body. The sensors are all
      soldered to PCBs and wired to an Arduino controller that plugs into the usb port of a computer running the Max patch that outputs the sound. The outputted
      trumpet sounds are recordings of a MIDI solo trumpet patch from the Kontakt Factory Library. Each pitch was recorded in both a soft and loud velocity, and
      the two versions are blended together with the ratio depending on how hard the user blows into the tube. The partials knob is divided into 6 segments and
      there are 7 possible valve combinations which are given values 0-6. The combination of the knob position and valve button combination determines the note
      that is played. The user must blow into the tube to activate the sound. Once a wind pressure threshold is reached, the user can freely adjust the
      valve buttons and partials knob to produce any note in the instrument's range (E3 - Bb5). The last component is the distance sensor in the back, which allows
      the user to produce muted trumpet sounds. Each note has a muted trumpet counterpart, and the two sounds are blended together with the ratio depending on how
      close the user's hand is to the sensor (the closer to the sensor, the more muted). This component is meant to mimic an acoustic trumpet player inserting a
      mute or their hand into the bell of their trumpet.</p>

      <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
      <p id="future">There are two major aspects of this instrument that I hope to improve in the future. The first is that the sensor the user blows into in
      a wind pressure sensor, not a wind speed sensor. Because of this, there is nowhere for the air to escape and it hurts my face to play after
      a while. A wind speed sensor with a vent would make it more comfortable to play and still achieve the desired affect. The second aspect I hope
      to improve upon is that at the present moment, the partials knob and valve buttons need to be changed with precise timing in order for the user to be
      able to play smooth melodies. I hope to find a way to make the timing more lenient so that smoother melodies are easier to play.</p>
